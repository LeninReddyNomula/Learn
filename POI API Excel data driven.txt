Apache POI is an excel accessing library to read or write file.

Add POI jar to the class build path.

FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream("file Location in the system");
XSSFWorkbook workbook = new XSSFWorkbook(fis); //we have to create an object for XSSFWorkbook to access the file
int sheets = workbook.getNumberofSheets(); //this gets numbor of sheets in an excel

XSSFSheet sheet = workbook.getSheetAt(i); //now sheet object holds the data of the sheet in excel

//by default the pointer will be at first row.

<Iterator> rows=sheet.iterator();//iterator helps to move to next
Row firstrow = rows.next(); //Row holds the data of the respective row

Iterator<cell>cellcontent = firstrow.cellIterator();
